What is CapyTux?
CapyTux is an os made in a few days, we only support qemu emulation for now, this whole os was make with buildroot,visual studio code and wsl.Its terminal based, were planning to upgrade it to include gui and maybe .exe files support for games. We have a lot of commands integrated : all commands in the help command, clicker,kris,capylator and time. Were thinking to add ruby,python and micropython programming support. Thanks to buildroot and  a little help this os is up and running in a terminal.This os runs on the Linux kernel (duh), we would really recommend u have an amd cpu or a really good intel and they can be with graphics integrated or not, we would like and prefer you have atleast 20 gb storage if you want to write your own commands.
Can i commit changes to it on GitHub?
Yes you can! We are launching it on GitHub so users can help me improve the os and a lot of stuff im having a hard time with. The os is licensed under the MIT license!
Can i share it on social media?
Yes and please do! We are trying to raise awareness about our operating system since this all cant go to nothing.
Will the people commiting the changes get credits?
Yes they will!Our credits-capybara command will launch when we actually finish our os.
Does CapyTux support files?
Depends. Are they .c files turned into .bat files? then it does. We are trying to integrate more and more files support.
